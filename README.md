## Technologies

I am using python version 3.7.10 and am importing the following from the built-in libraries and from functions i've created myself:
import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
from pathlib import Path

## Installation Guide

I have python version 3.7.10 and git version 2.33.0.windows.2 installed on a laptop running windows 10 pro.

I launch jupyter lab from the gitbash terminal and then run the risk_return_analysis noteback from the 
webpage that launches.

## Usage

Ensure the MCForecastTools.py file, gitignore file, and .env files are in the directory where you run financial_planning_tools.ipynb
from and the user should be good to go.  The user is free to update income or emergency fund threshold as needed. The user is also
free to change allocation percentages in the monte carlo simulations, the years we simulate, and even the tickers we look at for the
equity, bond, or crypto holdings.

That's it!
